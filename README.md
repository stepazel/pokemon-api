# pokemon-api
A RESTful API written in .NET C# with two resources - pokemons and trainers.

## Design

The solution has three logical layers and is an implementation of a "pragmatic clean architecture." For an app this size, it still provides a somewhat clean separation of concerns, while not adding a lot of unnecessary complexity.

The code itself is organized in vertical slices, as I find this approach more readable and logical.
